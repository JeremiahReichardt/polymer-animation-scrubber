#Polymer Animation Controller

This custom polymer element (`<control-panel>`) allows you to control another polymer element that tweens using Greensock's TimelineLite or TimelineMax object.

###To demo
Open in Brackets or run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and open localhost:8000 in your browser

###To use

1. Add a `<control-panel>` element inside the template of the tweening element and pass it a `timeline` property. E.g.:
`<control-panel timeline="{{timeline}}"></control-panel>`

2. The parent tweening component must also declare the instance of timeline as a property:

  ```
  properties: {
    timeline: {
      type: Object,
      notify: true
   }
  }
  ```

3. Assigning value to the timeline property may happen on `ready`, E.g.:

  ```
  ready: function() {
    this.timeline = new TimelineMax({ repeat: -1});
    this.timeline.pause();
    this.timeline.add( new TweenLite.to( this.$$('#whale'), 1, {x: '701px'}), 0);
  },
  ```


3b. Optionally if you wish to use the repeat delay funtionality, make sure the
   constructor of the timeline includes a `repeat: -1` value, as shown above.
  
Control of the Timeline instance is now given to the `<control-panel>` component.
